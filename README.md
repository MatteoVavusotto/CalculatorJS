Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This is just a small personal project I put together while studying JavaScript. I decided to build a simple (but hopefully cute!) calculator with some basic features. Nothing too fancyâ€”just the essentialsâ€”to help me get more comfortable with things like constructors, methods, and variables.

The main goal was to get some hands-on practice and really understand how JavaScript works under the hood, especially when it comes to object-oriented programming. Itâ€™s been a fun little challenge, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot in the process.

Feel free to check it out, and if you have any feedback or ideas to improve it, Iâ€™d love to hear them!!!
